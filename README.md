Snakefire source package for Ubuntu
===================================

[Snakefire](http://snakefire.org) is a desktop client for [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/) that can run on Linux, and any other OS that has QT support.

It's based on [pyfire](https://github.com/mariano/pyfire), a Campfire API written in python.

This repo was built to create a running version for Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr), and is based on [Mariano Pyfire](https://github.com/mariano/pyfire) + [James Broadhead fork](https://github.com/jamesbroadhead/snakefire) of Snakefire.
